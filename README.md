After cloning, please run "npm i" under each directory that is client/yocketAssigment and server separately.
To run the app first start the server by going into the server directory and run "npm start".
Then under the client directory go to the yocketAssignment directory and run "npm start". It will start the app.
To build, simply run npm run build in under above mention directories.
I have installed some Netlify related packages to deploy it in Netlify.
